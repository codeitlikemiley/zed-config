# Zed config

This is to port all possible keybindings , and rust specific config to [zed](https://docs.zed.dev/general/readme) 

The App is blazingly fast , but currently lacks ability to run runnables, debuggables and tests in rust.

As such there are keybindings left , reserve for those special usecases to be closely identical to my [neovide rust edition config](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/nvim)
